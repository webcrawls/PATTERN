questions
* should team links have descriptions?
* should team links have links to each person's socials?
* really unsure about the background video animation. feels cool but it also feels like it could be improved or changed, but idk what.
  * should the video only scroll on the first "screen"? i.e. should the video stay where it is on the page, or always follow the screen like it does now.
* how do we improve the loading bar.
* do we want analytics (past a single "page visit" count)
  * OMG, PAGE VISIT COUNTER _oN_ THE WEBSITE??!
